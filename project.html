    <h4>Finding Out</h4>
I didn't hear the information about we coding on the FreeCode Camp cuz i was having issues with my phone and laptop, so when i got them fixed i started coding and it was a bit difficult for me but the more i practice the more i get what i'm doing.

<h4>Continuation</h4>
Since i was late and the deadline was drawing near i had to sacrifice my sleep to do more so i can catch up. Some of my friends were complaining about their network being down so they were not able to continue that night, but they did the next day. When i started coding i didnt even know i was creating things like forms and menu and many more, so when i realized that was what i was doing it brought some joy in me, at least i've staryed coding.
Others really found it very stressing and  decided not to continue again.
